 The near-field Radiative Heat Transfer between to semi infinite α-MoO3 biaxial crystals is studied numerically using the fluctuation dissipation theorem combined with modified 4×4 transfer matrix method.It is found that the maximum heat flux is along the [001] direction, which can be explained by the existence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) inside α-MoO3 and excitation of
hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons (HSPhPs) at the vacuum/α-MoO3 interfaces.We also the study the effect of relative rotation between the two α-MoO3 crystals, we notice that the modulation contrast can be as high as two. This is attributed to the misalignment of HSPhPS and HPPs of the emitter and receiver.
